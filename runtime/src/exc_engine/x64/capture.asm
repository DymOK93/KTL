; The __CxxThrowException allocates `throw_fr` as its frame. This is
; a fairly large structure containing the non-volatile context of the calling
; function. `rip` and `rsp` are layed out in a machine frame format, so that
; they can be applied by the `iretq` instruction.
;
; The context starts out marked by `.allocstack`. However, once the context is
; unwound, the execution falls through to different funclet, in which the same
; frame structure is marked with `.pushframe` and a bunch of `.pushreg`s.
; At that point, it is safe to modify non-volatile registers -- this is the
; point at which the context is applied, save the machine frame.
;
; After that, through another fallthrough, the frame is transformed into
; a `catch_fr`, which is significantly smaller. `catch_info` and the machine
; frame stay in the same place. The exception object's copy constructor and
; then the catch handler funclet are called on top of this smaller stack.
;
; The stack looks like this.

	;
	; Once the target frame is found and potentially partially unwound,
	; the dispatcher will construct the catch variable, if any.
	;

	; in one of the destructors causes `std::terminate`, instead of
	; unwinding already unwound frames.

	; Since the thrower is right below us, the best we can do is make our own

	;
	; As such, we now immediately apply the non-volatile context and
